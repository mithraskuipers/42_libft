All my .c files have a test main inside them. However, to run it you need not
only to uncomment the main function, you also need to make it easy for the .c
file to find the header file. This is because you circumvent the Makefile, 
in which I explicitly tell the compiler where the header file is located. To run
the test main functions, simply relocate the libft.h into the src directory.
