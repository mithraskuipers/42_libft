If you get the following error:

VVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVV
src/tempCodeRunnerFile.c:1:1: error: expected ‘=’, ‘,’, ‘;’, ‘asm’ or ‘__attribute__’ at end of input

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

Solution:
Remove the tempCodeRunnerFile.c from the src folder.

Reason:
It is because in your src folder there is a file called 'tempCodeRunnerFile.c'
that shouldn't be there. It is probably made by VSCODE during debugging.
However, when you try to compile your library using your Makefile, it also
tries to compile this undesired temCodeRunnerFile.c with it. This is because
the Makefile is made such that it will detect ALL the .c files in the src folder.
